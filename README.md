Using a PyTorch CNN to classify the KNIST dataset

### Current accuracy:
93.77%


## Using

1. Create a [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) account if you don't have one
2. Download [Bonsai.ipnyb](https://github.com/Necl0/Bonsai/blob/main/Bonsai.ipynb) from this repo
3. Open it up in a Google Colaboratory notebook
4. Run all (Runtime -> Run all/Ctrl + F9)

### Progress
- [x] Implement a CNN approach
- [x] Fine tune the CNN to reach >93% acc
- [x] Upload model.pkl 
- [ ] Result analysis with seaborn 
- [ ] Publish articles on my model and the results
